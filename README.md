# BoidsFX
**Boids** is an artificial life program developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986,
which simulates the flocking behaviour of birds. [more info here...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids)

The rules applied in the simplest Boids world are as follows:
- **Separation**: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
- **Alignment**:steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
- **Cohesion**: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of 
local flockmates.
